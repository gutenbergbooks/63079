<p><span class="smcap">Independent</span> and savage, unrecognised by the
people in whose midst he lives, and whose society
and civilisation he has ever learnt to shun, the
Ottoman gipsy—of whom there are some two
hundred thousand souls—has neither political
nor literary history of his own, and is at once
the most brutal and degraded of all the wandering
races. Religious because it suits his convenience
to be so, submissive to law because he
fears punishment, he leads a wild and wretched
life, scarcely earning by his industry the wherewithal
to satisfy even the most frugal demands
of nature. Yet secure in his tent he defies the
world, and hates with an undying enmity all
strangers to his race. Can it then be wondered
at that neither Christian nor Mussulman bears
any great love for his unsociable neighbour, nor
cares to enter into commercial relationship with
him? Even those gipsies who have abandoned
tents for fixed dwellings have but little ameliorated
their condition, and are no less heartily despised on
that account. Their superficial religion, their inclination
to theft, their skill in deception, and their
brutal debaucheries, cause them to be distrusted
wherever they may chance to settle, and exclude
them for ever from participation in the benefits of
a more civilised state of society.</p>

<p>To deal firstly with the veritable wandering
gipsy, who knows no settled home, whose tents
dot the sunny landscapes of European Turkey,
Roumania, and Asia Minor, who is here one day
and there the next, the question arises, whither
goeth he and whence cometh he? We shall see.</p>

<p>About the middle of April, sooner or later
according to the season, he quits his winter’s
residence, or <i>gyshla</i> as he terms it, and begins to
roam the surrounding country. Some of his
kind descend from the north of the Balkans
and pass into Asia Minor; others mount where
their brethren descended, only to return about the
commencement of October; whilst some—and
these, in our humble opinion, by far the most
sensible—confine themselves, in their migrations,
to one single province, where they know the wants
of all and are known by all.</p>

<p>When cold and frost cut short their wanderings,
and warn them to beat a retreat, they unfailingly
return to their old quarters, where in the vicinity
of some open spring they dream away the wintry
hours, little molested by their Turkish neighbours.
Sometimes they enliven the monotony of
this season by a clandestine hunt, but it is more
from a desire to rob with impunity than from any
wish to nourish themselves on the game they
thus slay.</p>

<p>With black shaggy hair, bronzed weather-beaten
face, and dark brilliant eyes, the stalwart Mussulman
gipsy is by far the best type of his race.
He detests and distrusts all but the dwellers
in tents. Although familiarised with village life,
and often half frozen under his frail covering,
he prefers to die beneath his well-patched canvas,
to living restricted by the narrow walls and low
ceiling of a chamber. Nothing ever seems to
rouse the stolid indifference of one of this race.
He lives and dies as a beast. The habits of
his civilised neighbours, the garments of their
women, the cleanliness of their homes and children,
and their usually happy appearance, all
have no effect whatever upon him. At night-time
he retires to his tent to rest, and everything
he has seen is forgotten or looked upon as
an idle dream; and he works mechanically on
from day to day, without the slightest desire to
enter into the joyous stream of life with which he
finds himself surrounded.</p>

<p>Some few of his kind are so poor as to be unable
to purchase even a tent, and these are compelled
to dwell as they best may in hollow tree-trunks or
chasms in the rocks; whilst others, chiefly those of
Bosnia, have wooden bark-covered cabins, which
they remove from place to place, on unwieldy
wagons, drawn by from ten to a dozen oxen at a
time. Some work in iron, some are basket and
sieve makers. They are often oppressed, and seldom
if ever find defenders. Books and newspapers are
quite unknown to them, and the commonest of
domestic utensils find no place in their tiny tents.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>{226}</span>
About their origin they know little, though the
prophet Job, they say, taught their ancestors the
trade they now follow; and they have some slight
suspicion that they formerly came from Persia to
the country they at present occupy.</p>

<p>The Turks call them <i>Tchinganés</i>; whilst the
term they know one another by is <i>Rom</i>, the title
which binds the whole of the widely scattered
nomad tribes together. Their language itself is
styled Romany.</p>

<p>There is not the slightest allusion to a deity in
any of their most ancient songs and legends, and
they have no religious observances peculiar to
themselves alone. They have but one festival,
during which for three whole days they abandon
themselves to feasting and merriment. The fatted
lamb is slain by those who can afford it, the
tent decorated with flowers, and passers-by freely
invited to join their repast; all litigations and
legal processes are temporarily adjourned, and their
annual tax is then paid to the Turkish government.
One branch of their race, the <i>Zapari</i>, are the most
ferocious of their kind. They are to be found at
the village fêtes and large fairs, whither they go
to earn a few coins by the display of their dancing
bears or performing monkeys. Some few of them
are blacksmiths in winter. The Zapari are all
Mussulmans; and from their ranks the Sublime
Porte finds its supply of hangmen. They form
quite a distinct class of themselves, being held in
abhorrence even by their savage brethren. Outcasts
of outcasts, they stop short of no crime, and
are fitting companions for the much-talked-of
Bashi-Bazouks or wild marauders of the late
disastrous war.</p>

<p>But now to turn to the renegade or housed
gipsy. Still retaining the inherent desire for
liberty so common to his race, he avails himself
of his dwelling as a shelter only by night, traversing
the streets by day, tricked out in dirty gaudy
clothing, or seated with wife and family just
without the threshold of his hut, there frittering
the precious hours away. His children, if sent
to school at all, are only despatched there to be
out of the way, and his home is as devoid of
furniture and well-nigh as comfortless as the
ragged tent of his more Esau-like brother. Little
by little he forgets his old language, but not his
vicious habits, and very often ends by intermarrying
with some poor Greek family whose members
are as lazy and apathetic as himself.</p>

<p>Their language—descended from the old Sanscrit—has
besides giving the only real clue to
their origin, also shed some rays over the dark
period between the first emigration of the gipsies
from India and their appearance in Europe. Originally
the distinct mode of speech of a single and
special border tribe of Northern India, it has,
during the many wanderings of the race, appropriated
words from nearly every country through
which they passed; while on the other hand it
lost many of its own words, and still more of its
own inherent power and elegance; and much also
of its resemblance to the mother tongue. These
adopted foreign words, their relative number,
and their more or less corrupted state, point
plainly to the gipsies having passed from India
first into Persia, to their having remained there a
considerable time, and to their having wended
their way to some Greek country, perhaps Asia
Minor, and to their descent thence into their
present European homes.</p>

<p>It is worthy of further remark, as proof of their
Indian origin, that the speech of the English gipsies
has been found on comparison most marvellously
akin to that of the natives of Bombay, though
some of their words have, strangely enough, entirely
changed the meaning they at first possessed.</p>

<p>The speech of the Tchingané is rude, sharp,
strongly accentuated, and somewhat difficult to
comprehend. Properly spoken it is harmonious
enough, though rendered hoarse and almost distasteful
by the wild tribes who employ it. ‘We
speak,’ say they themselves, ‘as the birds sing,
but we sing as the lions roar!’ With them <i>papa</i>
signifies an apple, <i>cat</i> scissors, <i>rat</i> night, <i>Devel</i>
God, whilst <i>dad</i> seems to be the only word exactly
synonymous with any in our own language.</p>

<p>Heroic in suffering, the true Ottoman gipsy
never sheds a tear. On his legs to the last, he
only betakes himself to his couch when death is
too surely nigh, and departs without a murmur
from the life that has been so full of unhappiness
and misery to him. Buried apart from the rest of
humanity, and unwept even by his own, his low
moral nature is apt to be forgotten in his sad end,
though the unsuccessful efforts of more than one
philanthropical European Society testify to the
fact, that whatever else you may do with the
Ottoman gipsy, you will never succeed in even
partially civilising him.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XX.—AS GOVERNESS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> establishment at High Tor was by no means
on so sumptuous a scale as that which the much
larger revenues of Sir Sykes Denzil maintained at
Carbery Chase. Indeed, while for a baronet Sir
Sykes was rich, for an earl Lord Wolverhampton
was almost poor. There are poorer earls than he,
no doubt, dwelling in cheap watering-places or
in outlying London squares, and exhibiting their
pearl-studded coronets on no more pretentious
equipage than a brougham. But for a man of his
degree, and a De Vere withal, the Earl was not
wealthy. It was much to his credit that he was
popular in spite of the comparative slenderness of
his annual rent-roll, since a poor lord, like an
impoverished government, is apt to be regarded
with a sort of unreasoning contempt by those who
are very likely worse off, but in a less conspicuous
station.</p>

<p>To be rich is, after all, a very uncertain distinction;
that which is opulence to the Squire implying
mere substantial comfort when it belongs to Sir<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>{227}</span>
John, and but a moderate income when it has to
meet the calls which charity, duty, and custom make
on ‘my lord’s’ bank balance. Are there not nobles
of princely rank who declare that they are stinted
of pocket-money, of actual jingling sovereigns and
rustling notes, by the prudent administrators of
their vast nominal fortunes? And have we not
heard of mighty financiers who feel a positive
pang at any encroachment on the colossal capital
on which is reared the fabric of a world-wide
credit?</p>

<p>Lord Wolverhampton had been known to say
more than once among his intimate friends, that
a step in the peerage would to him prove a ruinous
boon; and that to keep his head above water,
difficult as an Earl, would be impossible were
that honest head overweighted by the strawberry-leaved
coronet of a Marquis. Such expensive promotion
was, however, unlikely, for High Tor now
sent forth no legislators to the more stirring of the
Houses of Parliament. Some two years before,
Lord Harrogate had been returned for a west-country
borough, and had earned some praise and
much good-will during the brief tenure of his seat.
But the session came to a close, and with it the
corporate life of the moribund House of Commons;
and the Earl could not bring himself again to face
the costly struggle of a contested election, even on
behalf of a son so promising as his heir.</p>

<p>Thus the fine old house of High Tor, though
lacking no adjuncts or appliances that should
appertain to the mansion of a plain country gentleman
who happened to have a handle to his name
(such was the Earl’s favourite way of describing
himself among those who knew him well, though
it may be doubted whether any patrician in
Europe cherished in secret a stronger sentiment
of family pride), was not kept up with quite
so ostentatious a lavishness as the neighbouring
dwelling of Carbery, the red gables of which
gleaming in the westering sun, never met Lord
Wolverhampton’s eyes without suggesting the
remembrance that it had been built and, till
recently, owned by a De Vere.</p>

<p>There was space enough and to spare in the
picturesque old mansion; and the chamber which
had been assigned to Ethel Gray, and which had
been formerly tenanted by that Miss Grainger
whose desertion of her post as governess to try the
experiment of wedded life we have heard the
Countess deplore, and which was next to the great
rambling school-room, commanded a noble prospect
over hill and dale, over wood and water. From
the ivy-framed windows, in clear weather, Dartmoor
might be seen for miles and leagues, rolling
away in giant waves of purple heather and gray
and green; while here and there rose up defiantly
the naked crags, known locally as Tors, frowning
like natural fortresses on the invader of the
wilderness.</p>

<p>Nearer, the two parks were visible, with all
their wealth of huge old trees and matchless turf,
browsed by hereditary deer, that couched contentedly
amid the tall fern that had screened the
antlered herds for centuries past, and the red roof
and gleaming vanes of stately Carbery, and the
peaceful waters of its ornamental lake, in which
the silver-white swans that floated there were
imaged back as from the polished surface of a
mirror. It was a pretty room this, wherein Miss
Grainger, its last occupant, had passed perhaps the
happiest years of her governess-life; and now it had
received a new tenant in the person of Ethel Gray.
A new tenant, but for how long? That was a question
which Ethel asked herself, without being able
to give a satisfactory answer to her own query.
The school-house of High Tor, with the modest
dwelling of its mistress, lay in ugly heaps of
blackened ruin; and it must be long before the
little flock of scholars could again be gathered
together in any building large enough to hold
them, and longer before the village instructress
could have a home to replace that which the
fire had made desolate. There were at the best
of times no lodgings in High Tor fit for the
abode of an educated girl such as Ethel, and now
every house that remained unharmed was overcrowded
by the burned-out inhabitants of those
which the conflagration had swept away.</p>

<p>It so chanced, however, that on the very day
following Ethel’s arrival the question as to the
prolongation of her sojourn at High Tor House
was conclusively settled. Lady Alice, a quick-witted
impulsive child, came swiftly down-stairs
to the room where her mother and sisters were
sitting. ‘Pray, come, Maud!’ she said breathlessly;
‘Gladys, you come too; and you, mamma.
It’s worth while, indeed it is, only to listen for
a moment!’</p>

<p>‘What is to be listened to?’ asked the Countess,
amused at the eager manner of her youngest
child.</p>

<p>‘Miss Gray’s singing, her wonderful, wonderful
singing!’ returned the child impetuously. ‘I
heard it by accident as I passed the door of the
school-room, where she is all alone at the piano;
and I could hardly tear myself away that I might
tell you not to lose the treat.’</p>

<p>The Countess laughed good-humouredly.</p>

<p>‘All Alice’s geese are swans,’ she said; ‘and I
am too old to climb so many stairs on the strength
of this young lady’s recommendation. You are
young, Maud, yourself, and I see you cannot resist
the temptation; nor you either, Gladys.’</p>

<p>And indeed the two elder of the Ladies De
Vere had allowed themselves to be convinced,
or at least rendered compliant, by the pleading
eyes and the energetic ‘Do come, please,’ of their
child-sister. It was some little time before they
returned.</p>

<p>‘Mamma, Alice was right; and you have lost
a treat worth a longer pilgrimage than that,’ said
frank Lady Gladys, coming down, with Alice,
radiant with delight, skipping at her side. ‘This
Miss Gray (Maud, who is really getting fond of
her, addresses her as “Ethel” already) has a
voice that might make her fortune if she were
less timid, and so sweet and liquid that one might
fancy it the carol of a bird. Such a touch too on
the keys! That jangling wheezy old school-room
piano, on which excellent Miss Grainger used to
pound so distressingly, gives out real music beneath
those fingers of hers, and becomes full-toned
and mellow. What a shame to throw away talent
such as that upon the A B C work of teaching
urchins the rudiments of knowledge!’</p>

<p>‘I never heard of these high musical attainments
of Miss Gray’s, I am sure,’ said the puzzled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>{228}</span>
Countess; ‘and I am almost as certain that your
father never heard of them either. She was
strongly recommended, I know, by an old college
friend of my lord, a clergyman somewhere, and
that is all I have learned concerning her. But if
she is such a performer as you describe, I should
like to hear her too.’</p>

<p>Lady Gladys shook her head. ‘I am not
sure,’ she said, ‘whether so shy a song-bird can
be coaxed into warbling before an audience of
strangers. She really did seem quite startled and
distressed when Alice began to clap her hands
and Maud and I broke in upon her. She had no
notion, she said, that her singing could be heard
by any of us in that out-of-the-way corner of so
large a house, and seemed to think she had taken
a great liberty and infringed rules of social decorum.
And it was all that even Maud, whom
she likes, could do to persuade her to sing again,
only a little bit of a ballad; but it all but brought
tears into my eyes, hackneyed girl of the world as
I am, you know.’</p>

<p>In explanation of which last speech, it may be
mentioned that Lady Gladys, the beauty of the
family, had gone through two London seasons
under the chaperonage of her mother’s sister, the
Marchioness of Plinlimmon, and that it was supposed
that if she had remained unmarried still,
it was not for want of offers matrimonial.</p>

<p>‘I was thinking, mamma,’ said Lady Maud, who
had lingered longer with Ethel than her sister had
done, ‘that you could scarcely do better than to
engage Miss Gray, if it suits her, as a governess for
Alice, instead of writing to every point of the compass
in hopes that some friend will recommend some
treasure. It’s not only that Ethel Gray is really
too good for the routine of plodding tuition in a
village school, but that she knows everything, or
nearly everything, that Miss Grainger knew, and
French and German quite as well as it is possible
to acquire them in England. Gladys has told you,
I am sure, what a musician she is. I do not know
how you could do better.’</p>

<p>The Countess too did not know how she could
do better than to engage such a successor to the
oft-quoted Miss Grainger, provided she possessed
the accomplishments with which she was credited,
and were willing—which Lady Wolverhampton
could scarcely doubt—to exchange her rustic pupils
for the post of governess at High Tor House.
And as, on inquiry, it seemed that Ethel’s acquirements
had not been overrated, and that her
magnificent voice and musical proficiency fully
merited the encomiums of the girls, while Alice
was a vehement partisan of the governess-elect,
the Countess was ready to propose the formal
installation of Ethel in that capacity, subject to
‘my lord’s’ approval, when he should return from
some magisterial business at Pebworth.</p>

<p>It was, however, necessary, in the Countess’s
opinion, to ask a question or two on other matters
than that of competence to teach. The office of
mistress of the village school was one thing; that
of governess to an Earl’s youngest daughter was
another. It would be satisfactory, the Countess
thought, to know a little more of Miss Gray’s
birth, parentage, and antecedents than any of the
De Vere family did as yet know. Ethel’s simple
frankness saved Lady Wolverhampton—who did
not like to put direct questions, and was eminently
unfit for the delicate operation of extracting by
subtle talk and veiled inquiry what she wished to
learn—a great deal of trouble.</p>

<p>‘My father is in Australia,’ she said, raising
her clear eyes to meet those of the Countess. ‘He
is, I believe, a merchant there; but even <i>that</i> I do
not know with any certainty, though he has been
living there for many years, and I have always
been told that I was born in the colony. I came
with him to England, I know, when I was a little
child, and he returned there; and I have not seen
him since then, and cannot remember him at all.’</p>

<p>Ethel’s story was a brief one. She had little to
relate, save of her early youth, spent at Sandston,
a minor bathing-place on the Norfolk coast, where
Mr Gray, a widower, who had paid but a short
visit to his native country, had left his only child
under the care of an excellent woman, one Mrs
Linklater, a widow and mistress of a lodging-house.
Ethel’s eyes grew dim as she spoke of
good motherly Mrs Linklater, at whose death,
three years before, she had been received into the
house of the clergyman, who had been a college
friend of the Earl, and to whose wife she had been
a sort of companion.</p>

<p>‘Dear Mrs Keating,’ said Ethel simply, ‘quite,
I am afraid, spoiled me. For years and years,
when Mrs Linklater was alive, I spent much of my
time at the vicarage; and Mrs Keating, who was
herself very accomplished, taught me almost all
the little that I know. She was fond of music,
and understood it as few understand it, and it is
through her kindness that I learned to sing and
play. She had no children living except the three
sons who were making their way in the world; and
I believe that she thought I was like a little
daughter she had lost, and whose name, like mine,
was Ethel, and so’——</p>

<p>‘And so she took you to live with her, when
this worthy Mrs—yes, Linklater died,’ said the
Countess encouragingly. ‘But how came you to
leave her?’</p>

<p>Ethel’s explanation of that was clear enough.
Mrs Keating’s health, always frail, had given way,
and she had been ordered to a warmer climate.
Dr Keating, who had accompanied his wife to
Mentone and Bellaggio, had a curate to pay and
heavy expenses to meet. It was necessary that
Ethel should get her own living; and it was at her
own suggestion that Dr Keating had sought for
her that appointment as mistress of a village
school which his acquaintance with the Earl had
enabled him to obtain for her at High Tor.</p>

<p>‘But your father?’ said the Countess, full of
sympathy, for she liked the girl better and better
for all that she saw or heard of her. Ethel smiled
somewhat sadly. Mr Gray, it appeared, seldom
wrote, and then very curtly, from Australia. For
nearly two years the customary remittance, sufficient
to defray the cost of his daughter’s maintenance,
had not reached Sandston. That he would
one day come back to England, Ethel hoped. He
had been, she feared, of late less prosperous in his
affairs than was formerly the case. Dr Keating
held the address in Sydney to which letters to the
widower had been hitherto addressed.</p>

<p>The matter was settled; the proposal that Ethel
should become governess to Lady Alice, and as
such should be permanently domiciled at High
Tor, was graciously made and gratefully accepted.</p>

<p>‘I shall have to look out for another schoolmistress,
it seems,’ said the good-natured old Earl;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>{229}</span>
‘but never mind that. Alice is pleased, and Maud
is pleased; and as Miss Gray seems to like it too,
I think we may say that some good came of our
luckless fire, after all.’</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the notable examples of popular delusions
regarding bodily structure and functions, is
exemplified by the belief that the third finger was
selected as the bearer of the wedding-ring because
a particular nerve placed this member in direct
communication with the heart. Over and over
again has this belief been expressed, and in the
belief is found an apparently satisfactory reason
why the third finger is thus honoured. The
slightest acquaintance with physiological science
shews that the supposition referred to has not
even a germ of probability to shew on its behalf.
The ring-finger is supplied with nerves according
to the rule of nervous supply in the body generally,
and, it need hardly be said, without the slightest
reference to the heart; the nerves of which in
turn are supplied from an independent source and
one quite dissociated from that which supplies the
nerves of the hand.</p>

<p>Equally curious and erroneous beliefs intrude
themselves into the domain of medicine and surgery.
Thus for instance it is a matter of ordinary
belief that a cut in the space which separates the
thumb from the forefinger is of necessity a most
dangerous injury. The popular notion regarding
this region is that an injury inflicted thereupon
is singularly liable to be followed by tetanus or
lock-jaw. There exist not the slightest grounds
for this supposition. Lock-jaw it is true might
follow an injury to this part of the hand, as it
might supervene after a wound of any of the
fingers. But physiology and medicine alike emphatically
dispel the idea that any peculiarity of
structure which might predispose to the affection
just named, exists <i>chiefly</i> in the region of the
thumb. It may be that the difficulty experienced
in securing the healing of wounds in this
portion of the hand—owing to the amount of
loose tissue and to the free movements of the part
which it is almost impossible to prevent—might
favour or predispose to an attack of tetanus. But
as the same remark may be made of many other
portions of the body, it follows that the thumb-region
possesses no peculiarity whatever in this
respect over any other part of the frame.</p>

<p>One of the points which has been most hotly
contested in technical as well as in popular physiology
is the use and functions of the <i>spleen</i>. This
organ, as most readers are aware, is a gland, of
somewhat oval shape, lying close to the left side
or extremity of the stomach. It is one of the
so-called ‘ductless’ glands of the body—that is,
it possesses no duct or outlet, as do the liver,
sweetbread, and other glands concerned with the
formation of special fluids used in digestion and
other functions. In olden times philosophers
puzzled themselves over this mysterious organ;
nor was its nature rendered any clearer by the
discovery of the fact that it may be removed
from the bodies of the higher animals without
causing any great or subsequent inconvenience,
and without affecting in any perceptible degree
the health of the subject operated upon. One
classical authority went so far as to allege that
he could find no use whatever for the organ;
whilst another maintained that possibly it was
intended to serve as a kind of packing for the
other organs around it, and that it kept them
from getting out of their places in the movements
of the body. The idea, however, which
obtained most credence was that which regarded
the spleen as the fountain and origin of all the vile
‘humours’ which rankled the blood and soured
the disposition of man. We can still trace in the
metaphorical expressions of our literature this
ancient belief; so that what at first were regarded
as literal and true ideas of the spleen and its use,
have come in modern days to do duty simply as
metaphors.</p>

<p>Modern science, in dispelling those antiquated
notions, has now assigned to the spleen a very
important part in our internal mechanism. The
part it plays may be thus described. The
blood, as every one who has looked at a thin
film of that substance through a microscope
will know, is in reality a fluid as clear as
water, and derives its colour from the immense
number of little red bodies the ‘corpuscles,’
which float in it. These red corpuscles of human
blood do not attain a greater size than the
1/3500th part of an inch—that is, three thousand
five hundred of these little bodies placed in a
line would make up an inch in length. In addition
to the red bodies, there exist in the blood a
much smaller number of ‘white corpuscles,’ each
containing a little central particle which the red
ones want. From the results of the most recent
researches it would appear that the red corpuscles
are produced by the partial destruction of the
white ones; and that the little central particles of
the white globules, when coloured, appear before
us as the red corpuscles of the blood. Now the
spleen is to be regarded as the great manufactory
or <i>depôt</i> in which the red corpuscles are thus
produced from the white ones, and in which also
many of the white corpuscles are themselves
developed. And it would also appear highly
probable, that when the red globules of the blood
have served their turn in the economy of the
body they are broken down in the spleen; their
material being doubtless used for some wise
purpose in the maintenance of our complicated
frame.</p>

<p>A very common idea, but one founded on no
certain or feasible grounds, is that which maintains
that our bodies undergo a complete change
and renewal of all their parts every seven years.
The ‘mystical’ nature of the number seven, has
had an unquestionable effect in originating this
opinion; and although the age of fourteen and
again that of twenty-one may be regarded as
marking the attainment of youth and manhood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>{230}</span>
or womanhood respectively, yet physiology gives
no countenance to the popular opinion that of
necessity these periods are those of sweeping
bodily change. On the contrary, it might be
shewn that the periods at which full growth of
body is attained vary with climate, race, and
constitution—that is, with the personal nature,
and with the physical surroundings of individuals,
communities, and nations. The true state of
matters as disclosed by physiology, leads us to
contemplate actions and changes which are of
infinitely more wondrous kind than those involved
in the idea of septennial change. For if there
is one axiom which physiology maintains more
constantly than another, it is that which teaches
that constant and <i>never-ceasing</i> change is the lot
of life from its beginning to its end.</p>

<p>No part of the body of a living being is free
from these changes of substance, through which
indeed every act of life is carried on. Every
movement of a muscle—the winking of an eyelid
or the lifting of a finger—implies waste of the
organs and parts which move. The thinking of
a thought implies wear and tear of the organ
which thinks—the brain itself. Were it possible
to spend existence even in a perfectly still and rigid
condition, there are still actions to be performed
which are necessary for the maintenance of life,
and which necessitate continual waste and wear
of the tissues. Thus the beating of the heart, the
movements of our chest in breathing, and the
very act of receiving and digesting food—actions
which are in themselves concerned with the repair
of the frame—can only be performed through
the intervention of processes of work, and waste
of body. So that a living being is to be
regarded as passing its existence in a constant
state of change. Its particles are being continually
wasted, and as incessantly renewed; and
although the growth of our bodies may be said
to culminate at various periods of our life, yet
it is anything but correct to say that there are
marked epochs of change in human existence.
The truth is that change and alteration are our
continual heritage; and it is strange indeed to
think that not an organ or part of our bodies
exists which has not repeatedly in its history
been insensibly and gradually, but none the less
perfectly, renewed in all its parts. Our particles and
substance are being dissipated in very many ways
and fashions. Chemically and physically, we are
in a state of continual break-down; whilst on the
other hand, it may be shewn that the forces of
life are enlisted powerfully on the side of renewal
and repair.</p>

<p>In connection with the exercise of our senses
there are not a few points on which popular ideas
stand in need of correction. When we speak of
‘seeing’ or ‘hearing,’ the exercise of these or any
other of our senses indeed, is usually referred to the
organ concerned—eye, ear, nose, or tongue, as the
case may be. A little consideration, however, will
shew us that we make a very grievous mistake
in referring the act of sensation or perception to
the organ itself. Let us consider for a moment
what happens when we acquire ideas regarding the
form of an object through the sense of touch. We
may in the first place ‘will’ to touch the object
in question; the act of ‘volition’ as it is termed,
originating in the brain, being transformed into
nerve-force, and being further directed along the
particular nerves which supply the muscles of one
finger or along those which supply all the fingers.
The muscles are thus stimulated to action, and
through their agency the fingers are brought into
contact with the desired object. Leaving the
sense of sight out of consideration for a moment,
we know that we can through the sense of touch
gain ideas regarding the form, size, hardness, and
other qualities of the object. Our nervous system
is thus bringing us into relation with the outer
world and specially with that portion of it represented
by the object we have touched. But
how have we gained our knowledge? The reply
to this question leads us at once to perceive
that the tips of the fingers do not represent the
seat of knowledge. And a further consideration
makes it equally clear that the brain must be
credited not only with the task of perceiving, but
also with that of appreciating what has been perceived.
Hence we are forced to conclude that
just as the first nervous impulse shot through the
nerves to the fingers, so a second impulse has
passed from the fingers to the brain. Our sense
of touch has given origin to a subtle force which
has passed upwards to the brain, and has there
become transformed, through a mechanism—of the
working of which we know as yet absolutely nothing—into
perception and thought. Similarly with
the work of the eye, of the ear, and of other
senses.</p>

<p>When we talk of seeing or hearing, we
are in reality speaking of the act of the brain,
not of the eye or ear, which are merely the
‘gateways’ through which the brain obtains its
knowledge. And that the brain is the true seat
of the senses, may be proved to us from the side
of pathology—the science which makes us acquainted
with the causes and nature of disease.
Cases are well known in which injury of the brain
as the seat of sense has given origin to depraved
sensations. Post-mortem examinations of persons
who were continually conscious of a disagreeable
odour have proved that these persons had laboured
under brain-disease; whilst one case is on record
in which, after a fall from a horse, and for several
years before his death, a person believed that he
smelt a bad odour. So also the sense of sight
may be altered from internal causes, and on this
ground may be explained the real nature of many
cases of so-called ghost-seeing and spectral illusions.
One well-known case, in illustration of
this latter point, was that of Nicolai, a Berlin bookseller,
who, neglecting to be bled in accordance
with his usual custom, began to see strange persons
in his room, and faithfully described the appearance
of the figures. The figures disappeared when
he had been bled once more. Thus in all such
cases we must believe that those parts of the eye
or ear which would have been concerned in seeing
the supposititious objects or hearing the supposititious
sounds—had either existed—were irritated
from the brain and produced the delusive sensations.
Thus the common phrase that ‘seeing is
believing’ is in one sense literally true; for the
act of sight apparently exercised in the person who
suffers from optical illusions is in reality performed
by the brain and is thus an act of belief,
even if it be one of unconscious kind. The entire
subject of physiological errors teems with valuable
applications, but with none more practical or
worthy of remark than that which would insist<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>{231}</span>
on the advantages, in the ruling wisely of our lives,
to be derived from even an elementary acquaintance—such
as should be included in the curriculum
of every school—with the science of life.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="MR_ASLATTS_WARD">MR ASLATT’S WARD.</h2>
</div>


<h3 title="CHAPTER II.">IN FOUR CHAPTERS.—CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">I did</span> not then know what I afterwards learned,
the full extent of her obligations to Mr Aslatt,
nor the sentiments of love which that gentleman
came to entertain for his beautiful ward. A
pretty child of six, singing in the streets of a
foreign city, she had first attracted his notice; and
her sad lot had so touched his heart, that he could
not rest till he had rescued her from it. The
itinerant musicians in whose company he found
her spoke of her as an orphan, the child of a
former comrade, and made no objection when Mr
Aslatt proposed to adopt her and provide for her
future. He was a lonely man, with no near
relatives to resent this action on his part; and the
child became the delight of his life and the idol of
his heart. He was but a young man when he
took the little orphan under his protection, and his
friends thought it an alarming proof of the eccentricity
which had already marked him. But a
bitter disappointment had blighted his life, and
made it impossible, he then thought, for him ever
to have a happy married life, such as he had once
anticipated. He determined to spend his wealth
in giving brightness to the existence of the little
fairy-like creature, who seemed made to live in the
sunshine; and in the effort to promote little Rose’s
happiness he found his own. When it was that
his paternal fondness for her passed into a warmer
more passionate emotion, and he experienced a
longing to bind her to himself by the closest of all
ties, I could not know; but that such was the
nature of his regard for her when I went to reside
at his house, was beyond doubt.</p>

<p>And it was equally plain that Rose entertained
for him a very different feeling. She looked upon
him as her dear guardian and friend, one who
had been as a father to her; but I do not think
the possibility of any other relationship had ever
crossed her mind. Indeed it was pretty evident
to me that another was frequently in her thoughts
to the exclusion of Mr Aslatt, who was so untiring
in his efforts to win her love. I was grieved to
see how often she wounded him by her thoughtless
wilful conduct; and the patience with which
he bore with her capricious moods, fully enlisted
my sympathies on his behalf. If any word of
mine could have influenced my wayward charge
to value more highly her true-hearted friend,
it would have been spoken; but from what I
knew of her, I judged that I should better serve
Mr Aslatt’s cause by silence than by speech.</p>

<p>On the day following that of our excursion to
Ashdene, Rose took me for a drive in her little
shell-shaped chaise, drawn by two pretty Shetland
ponies. We drove through narrow country
lanes with hedges gay with wild-flowers, and
across a breezy common covered with golden
furze-bushes, returning by a road which led us
through the village.</p>

<p>‘This is the school-house,’ said Rose as we
approached a rather imposing-looking structure
in red brick; and without another word she
pulled up her ponies and alighted.</p>

<p>I followed her into the large school-room, which
at that hour was deserted. Mr Hammond, however,
had heard our entrance, and almost immediately
came in from an inner room. The bright
flush which tinged Rose’s cheek as he appeared,
and the somewhat conscious manner in which
she greeted him, seemed to confirm my previous
surmises. He was certainly a very handsome man;
and his manner and bearing were in striking contrast
to his position. I could not wonder that a
girl like Rose should be fascinated by his appearance
and address, even while, in spite of his efforts
to please me, the feeling of distrust with which
I had at first regarded him, deepened. From
what I observed during that interview, I felt pretty
certain that some private understanding already
existed between him and Rose. I dared not
question my wilful charge, knowing well how her
proud spirit would resent any interference from
me. Yet I longed to do something to prevent
this man from obtaining a fatal influence over
her heart. But I could only wait and watch for
what time might reveal, resolved meanwhile to
accompany Rose whenever she paid a visit to the
school-house. I saw that this precaution of mine
afforded satisfaction to Mr Aslatt.</p>

<p>The summer weeks passed away swiftly and
pleasantly with me. But the signs of secret sorrow
became more plainly visible on Mr Aslatt’s countenance,
and I felt sure he was tortured with
anxiety on account of Rose’s intimacy with the
schoolmaster. I sometimes wondered that he did
not dismiss Mr Hammond from his post, but I
suppose he dreaded Rose’s reproaching him with
injustice; for in truth the schoolmaster appeared
most exemplary in the discharge of his duties,
and no reasonable ground of complaint could
be found. I became anxious also, as I saw every
week fresh proofs of Rose’s attachment to Mr
Hammond. At last a day arrived when my
suspicions as to the existence of a secret understanding
between the two were confirmed in
a most unexpected manner. It was a warm
September evening. Rose, complaining of a headache,
had retired early to rest, and I was about
to follow her example, when looking from my
window at the calm beauty of the garden as it
lay in the clear light of the moon, I was tempted
to take a stroll. Wrapping a shawl about me,
I went down the steps leading into the garden,
and slowly walked down the green alley bordered
by tall laurel bushes. It was almost as light as
day until I reached the end of the walk, where
some large trees obscured the moonbeams. As
I passed into their shadow I thought of the warning
Rose had given me on the night of my arrival.
I smiled at the remembrance; and in order to
prove to myself that I had no fear of supernatural
encounter, I turned into the path which led
towards that part of the house said to be haunted.
Here the gloom deepened, for the shrubs and trees
in this portion of the garden had been neglected,
and suffered to grow at will, until they intertwined
their branches overhead, forming a leafy
covering.</p>

<p>‘How frightened Rose would be, if she were
here,’ I thought; but the next moment I became
conscious that my own bravery was not worth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>{232}</span>
much. A sudden rustling amongst the leaves
close at hand startled me, and involuntarily I
turned to go back. But ashamed of my cowardice,
I almost immediately turned round again, and
peering through the bushes in the direction from
which the sound had come, tried to discover its
cause. ‘It was merely some dog or cat straying
amongst the shrubs,’ I said to myself, trying to
shake off the fear which had taken possession of
me. But again I heard the sound more distinctly
than before, and it seemed to me that some one
must be walking along the path on the other side
of the shrubbery. But I could see nothing, and
my heart began to beat violently in dread of I
knew not what. A cloud had passed over the
moon, and the wind was rising and making a
mournful ‘sough’ amongst the trees, which was not
reassuring. I shivered; and drawing my shawl
closely around me, again turned to leave the
garden. But once more the sound fell upon my
ear, and at the same moment my eyes were
arrested by the appearance of a white ghost-like
figure standing on the steps leading from the
haunted room. In spite of my boasted disbelief
in supernatural appearances, for an instant I really
thought that the shadowy form I beheld must be
the denizen of another world. I stood motionless,
rooted to the spot by fear. It was but for
a moment that the figure was visible; as I
gazed upon it, it glided slowly down the steps
and disappeared in the gloom. I can smile now
to think how terror-struck I was as I watched its
disappearance. Suddenly I heard again the sound
which had at first awakened my fears, now close
at hand, and almost immediately I felt something
cold touch my hand. I uttered a faint cry, and
should have swooned, I verily believe, if a low
familiar whine had not assured me that Nero was
by my side, and had thrust his nose into my
hand. Hitherto, I had regarded Rose’s rough pet
with some trepidation, but now his presence was
most welcome, and I laid my hand on his shaggy
head, in order to keep him by my side. But he
would not be retained, and breaking from me, ran
down the path towards the spot where my supposed
ghost had vanished. The next minute I
heard him barking loudly, and the sound of his
hearty voice dissipated my absurd fears. ‘Nero
evidently has no fear of ghosts,’ said I to myself,
as with growing courage I advanced to discover
the cause of his excitement.</p>

<p>As I approached the end of the path, Nero’s
barking ceased, and to my astonishment, I heard
a well-known voice gently coaxing him to be
quiet. I turned a corner, and beheld Rose standing
by a door which led from the garden into the
road. She wore a dress of gray alpaca, and had
a white shawl of flimsy texture twisted around
her shoulders. She carried her hat and a small
travelling-bag in her hand, and had evidently
been about to unlock the door, when Nero had
arrested her movements. In a moment I was at
her side, and laying my hand on her arm inquired:
‘What is the meaning of this, Rose?’ She had
not heard my approach, and my sudden appearance
startled her so much, that even in the dim
light I could perceive that her face grew very
pale.</p>

<p>For a few moments she could make no reply,
then shaking off my grasp, she exclaimed: ‘Let
me alone; I must and will go!’ She took hold of
the key, and strove to turn the lock, but her hand
trembled so that she could not manage it.</p>

<p>Without a moment’s hesitation, I wrenched the
key from her grasp and put it into my pocket.
‘You shall not leave the garden at this hour,’
I said, ‘if it is in my power to prevent it.’</p>

<p>Just then a low whistle was heard from the
other side of the wall. Rose started at the sound,
and wrung her hands in grief and dismay. ‘Do
not stop me, Miss Bygrave!’ she implored. ‘I
assure you, it is better I should go now. We are
acting for the best.’</p>

<p>‘How can it be for the best, Rose,’ I exclaimed
indignantly, ‘that you should deceive and pain
your kind guardian, for the sake of an unprincipled
man? But you have not reflected on what
you were about to do. Thank God, I was led here
in time to prevent your taking a step which
would entail lifelong misery!’ So saying, I took
her hand, to lead her back to the house. Seeing
that I was resolute, she made no opposition. We
went at once to her room, which was not far from
my own. It was in great disorder, various articles
lying scattered about on the floor and chairs. On
the dressing-table lay various articles of jewellery
and other presents from Mr Aslatt, and a note
directed to him in Rose’s handwriting.</p>

<p>‘And so, you thought by returning these, you
could escape from some of your obligations to
Mr Aslatt,’ I remarked, somewhat scornfully, as I
pointed to the pile of gifts. ‘I am surprised at
you, Rose!’</p>

<p>Overpowered by shame and vexation, she could
make no reply, but throwing herself as she was
upon the bed, gave vent to her mortification in
passionate sobs. I sat down by her side and let
her weep unchecked, hoping that no more words
would be needed to move her to contrition.
After a while she grew calmer, and ceasing to
sob, lay still, with her eyes shut. Occasionally
her eyelids moved, and I knew that she was not
asleep; but I would not be the first to break
silence. About an hour passed thus, and then
she opened her eyes, and raising herself on her
elbow, and shaking back the fair hair that was
hanging loose over her face, turned towards me.
‘Shall you tell Cousin?’ she asked in a faint
voice.</p>

<p>‘I fear it will be my duty to do so,’ I replied;
‘though I shrink from the thought of the pain I
shall inflict.’</p>

<p>Rose’s lip quivered, and tears again gathered in
her eyes. ‘I know you must consider me very
wicked,’ she said; ‘but indeed I am not so bad
as you think. I am fully conscious how much I
am indebted to Mr Aslatt, and I am grateful to
him for the kindness he has always shewn me.’</p>

<p>‘How can you say so,’ I interrupted, ‘when
you have deliberately planned what would cause
him the bitterest sorrow?’</p>

<p>‘I know, I know!’ exclaimed Rose passionately.
‘Do you suppose I have ignored the sorrow my
flight would cause my dear guardian, or that I
would willingly appear so ungrateful? But I had
to consider the happiness of another.’</p>

<p>‘What other can have stronger claims upon you
than Mr Aslatt?’ I asked.</p>

<p>Rose coloured, and hesitated for an answer. ‘If
I had a husband,’ she said in a low voice with
downcast eyes, ‘he would have a higher claim
upon me than any one else.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>{233}</span></p>

<p>‘Of course,’ I returned. ‘But you are not
married, so I do not see what that has to do
with it.’</p>

<p>‘This much,’ said Rose—‘that I have promised
to marry Mr Hammond, and would have been
married to-morrow if you had not stopped me;
therefore he is more to me than any one else.’</p>

<p>‘I am very thankful that I did stop you,’ I said.
‘How could you expect, Rose, to find any happiness
in a union so hastily and wilfully contracted?
How could you think of fleeing by night from the
home where you have been sheltered since your
childhood, where your every wish has been gratified,
and ample provision made for your happiness,
by one whose noble love you are incapable of
appreciating? You have been strangely deluded
to think of trusting your life to one who could
propose so base a scheme.’</p>

<p>‘But what else could we do?’ said Rose, trying
to defend her lover. ‘All things are fair in love
and war. We knew that Mr Aslatt would never
consent to our marriage. But if he heard that we
were actually married, so that it was out of his
power to separate us, he must then have forgiven
us.’</p>

<p>‘So I have no doubt Mr Hammond thought,’ I
remarked. ‘But Rose, do you positively think
that Mr Aslatt would withhold his consent to
your marriage if he were convinced that it would
promote your happiness?’</p>

<p>‘No, not if he believed that,’ replied Rose. ‘But
nothing would persuade him that Fritz Hammond
could make me a good husband; he is dreadfully
prejudiced against him. And he would never
overlook Mr Hammond’s inferior position or forgive
him for being poor, although he comes of a
good family, and no one can say anything against
him.’</p>

<p>‘It is strange,’ I remarked, ‘that being of good
family he should be in his present position.’</p>

<p>‘There now; you are going to find fault with
him!’ exclaimed Rose pettishly. ‘He is not to be
blamed for his position, for great misfortunes have
reduced him to it.’</p>

<p>‘How long is it since you promised to marry Mr
Hammond?’ I inquired, after a pause.</p>

<p>‘A little while before you came here,’ was the
reply. ‘At first we meant to tell Mr Aslatt all,
and ask his consent; but he seemed so much
opposed to Mr Hammond, that he—I mean <i>we</i>—feared
to do so. We thought that if we settled
the matter ourselves, it would cause Cousin less
pain in the end.’</p>

<p>‘Less pain to find that you had been deceiving
him, and putting more confidence in a comparative
stranger, than in one who has befriended you
all your life! It was by strange reasoning you
arrived at such a conclusion, Rose!’</p>

<p>She made no reply.</p>

<p>‘I suppose you have been in the habit of meeting
Mr Hammond clandestinely in the garden,’ I
continued; ‘you gaining access to it unobserved
by means of the so-called haunted rooms, against
which you were so careful to warn me. I could
not have believed you so skilled in subterfuge.’</p>

<p>Rose coloured deeply, and her head drooped in
shame. ‘I am very sorry, Miss Bygrave,’ she said
penitently, after a long pause; ‘I see now that
I have acted wrongly. I have felt very unhappy
all along at the thought of deceiving my
good Cousin, for indeed I love him truly; but I
could not bear to think of giving up Mr Hammond.
I have often longed to confess all to you, and I
asked Fritz once if I might; but he said it would
be most imprudent, and would lead to his being
parted from me for ever. And now that will come
to pass, I suppose. O dear me! what shall I do?
I am the most miserable girl in the world!’ So
saying, Rose again buried her face in the pillow
and sobbed aloud.</p>

<p>‘Do you know what I should advise you to do?’
I said, when her emotion had somewhat exhausted
itself.</p>

<p>‘What?’ she asked in a smothered voice, without
raising her head.</p>

<p>‘I think the best thing—the right thing for you
to do is to confess all to Mr Aslatt, and beg his
forgiveness. He will accord it, I have no doubt.
It will give him great pain to hear of your folly;
but it will grieve him less to learn it from your
lips than from mine.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I cannot, Miss Bygrave! I cannot tell him!
I don’t know what he would do or say. He would
be so angry with Mr Hammond!’</p>

<p>‘And he has just cause to be,’ I could not
help saying. ‘But surely, Rose, your past experience
of Mr Aslatt’s goodness should lead you to
put more trust in his kindness of heart. You
must know that he seeks your happiness in everything.
He will undoubtedly feel indignant with
the schoolmaster on account of the underhand
manner in which he has acted. But if he is convinced
that you are sincerely attached to each
other, he will not, I believe, oppose your union;
unless he has grave reasons for thinking Mr
Hammond unworthy of the place he holds in your
heart. You cannot expect that he will all at once
consent to your marrying a man who may be a
mere adventurer, for all that we know to the contrary,
and who has certainly acted towards Mr
Aslatt in a dishonourable manner, which the
hopelessness of his suit does not seem to me to
excuse.’</p>

<p>Rose made no reply; and I trusted my words
would have their influence. She lay still for
some time, evidently engaged in deep and painful
thought. Gradually, however, the cloud passed
from her brow, and as morning was beginning to
dawn, she fell into a sound sleep. I watched her
for a while; but by degrees weariness overcame
my mental excitement, and I also fell asleep.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="BRITISH_GUIANA">BRITISH GUIANA.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the vast extent of the South American continent
the far-reaching empire of Great Britain has
planted its flag in one place only; it possesses
one-fifth of the country of Guiana, which lies
within the Torrid Zone, and forms the northern
portion of South America. Of that fifth section
of Guiana, which is called Demerara—the capital
of which is George-town—only the civilised and
cultivated part is known to the dwellers in the
colony, or to its chance visitors. The remaining
portion of the country was, however, a terra incognita
to all but a very few, until Mr Barrington
Brown, in his <i>Canoe and Camp Life in British
Guiana</i> (London: Edward Stanford), published
the results of his explorations.</p>

<p>The civilised and cultivated portion of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>{234}</span>
colony of British Guiana consists of a narrow strip
of sea-coast. Immediately behind this lies a broad
expanse of swampy ground, then comes rising
wooded land, and finally mountains and savannas
which stretch westward, and are still in their
primitive condition, inhabited by little-known
Indian tribes and various species of wild animals.
It is owing chiefly to the ‘Coolie Labour Question’
that public attention has been of late years at
all directed to British Guiana; and as the colony
is likely to become of increased importance, an
opportunity of learning particulars about the
hitherto mysterious territory which lies <i>behind</i> the
utilised strip of coast belonging to it, yet utterly
unreckoned in the sum of civilisation, is one to
be welcomed. This wild region is called vaguely
‘the Interior,’ and with the exception of a few
settlements on the banks of the Lower Berbice,
Demerara, and Essequibo rivers, a traveller penetrating
its recesses at the present time would
behold the same condition of things there which
existed in the days of Sir Walter Raleigh. Mr
Barrington Brown visited and explored a considerable
extent of this ‘Interior’ while he was engaged
on the government geological survey of the West
Indies. He accomplished his journeys by means
of canoe-travelling; a method preferable to any
other, as affording opportunities for close observation,
for obtaining picturesque aspects, and in
itself very agreeable.</p>

<p>His first voyage was up the Essequibo to the
penal settlement of the colony, where his Indian
boatmen refused to remain even for one night, such
is their timid dread of the very notion of a prison.
They would not hang their hammocks in the
empty sheds, but crossed the river and camped
in the forest, though one of them was suffering
severely from fever. At the penal settlement
boats were purchased, and a crew hired for the
navigation of the Cuyuni, which afforded the
Indians ample opportunities for exhibiting their
skill. ‘They worked splendidly in the cataracts,
swimming, diving, and wading in the strong
currents from rock to rock, while leading out the
tow-ropes and hauling the boats up.’ During the
journey up this river the traveller encountered in
many parts a succession of rapids and cataracts.
The difficulties thus entailed, and the graphic
account of how these difficulties were surmounted,
afford some notion of the laboriousness of nearly
every river voyage made by Mr Brown in the
course of his explorations.</p>

<p>The scenes through which he passed were of
rich and varied beauty. Nothing terrible or
threatening met his sight in that unknown land,
which seems to bear upon its face one broad beaming
smile, answering with fidelity to the smile of
the sun. Rocky islets bearing clusters of low
trees, whose stems and branches are covered with
orchids and wild pines, rise from the broad bosom
of the river, while its banks are clothed with
forest trees; and on the rocks under its waters is
a luxuriant growth of water-plants, bearing exquisite
flowers. When the sun is high, gorgeous
butterflies, yellow, orange, and azure blue, frequent
the water’s edge in clusters, or flit over
the open spaces near the cataracts; and the river
abounds in deep-bodied silvery-scaled fish of
various kinds.</p>

<p>The character of the scenery along the banks
of the rivers, which form a kind of network over
the face of the country in Guiana, is chiefly of the
kind described above; but there is no monotony
in it, and the traveller is kept constantly amused
by the birds and the insect life. Morning and
evening are marked by bands of screeching parrots
crossing the river to and from their feeding-grounds,
and all along the banks the kingfisher
and the ibis abound. The Indian villages are
generally within a short distance of the river, and
the harmless people are unusually smart in their
attire. The women wear an apron called a
<i>queyon</i>, formed of cotton and bead-work, ingeniously
manufactured, each bead being slipped on
the cotton thread in its proper place as it is being
woven. The traveller frequently halted at the
villages while the natives prepared cassava bread
for him, and he had a fair opportunity of forming
a judgment upon their intellectual status and
social condition. Both are superior to those
of the average ‘natives’ with which books have
made us acquainted, and Mr Brown notes as a
‘pleasing feature’ of the British Guiana Indians,
that, as a rule, they treat their women well,
regarding them as equals and not as slaves. The
planters of the civilised portion of the country,
kidnappers and tyrants of the ‘coolie,’ might learn
lessons of humanity and justice from the ‘savages’
of the ‘Interior.’</p>

<p>A march through primeval forest to the Puruni
was a less pleasant experience than the river
voyage; for the ‘ticks’ which infest the forest took
possession of the travellers. Of the numerous
kinds of pestilent insects Mr Brown gives a horrid
description; but he counterbalances it by that of
the birds, the trees, the flowers, the skies, and the
wonderfully exhilarating influence of the climate.</p>

<p>The many mysterious sounds which proceed
from primeval forest in all countries where such
forest exists, have given rise to superstitious beliefs
and fears. On their return journey to the penal
settlement, Mr Brown was made acquainted with
the legendary ‘Didi’ of those remote realms of
forest and river. ‘The first night after leaving
Peaimah,’ he says, ‘we heard a long, loud, and
most melancholy whistle proceeding from the
depths of the forest; at which some of the men
exclaimed in an awed tone of voice: “The Didi!”
Two or three times the whistle was repeated,
sounding like that made by a human being,
beginning in a high key and dying slowly and
gradually away in a low one. There were conflicting
opinions amongst the men regarding the
origin of these sounds. Some said they proceeded
from the wild hairy man or Didi of the Indians;
others that they were produced by a large and
poisonous snake which lives in one tree from its
youth up, where it attains a great size, living on
birds which are so unfortunate as to alight near it,
and thus become victims to its powers of fascination.
The Didi is said by the Indians to be a
short, thick-set, and powerful wild man, whose
body is covered with hair, and who lives in the
forest. A belief in the existence of this fabulous
creature is universal over the whole of British,
Venezuelan, and Brazilian Guiana. On the Demerara
River I afterwards met a half-bred woodcutter,
who related an encounter that he had with
two Didi, a male and female, in which he successfully
resisted their attacks with his axe.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>{235}</span></p>

<p>The main object of the explorer’s most important
voyage up the Essequibo was to obtain a sight of
the great Roraima Mountain, which has been seen
by few white men.</p>

<p>He began to ascend from the river-bank, under
the guidance of an Indian, at the valley of the
Cotinga; and first he saw, rising two hundred feet
above the level of the plain, the great Waetipu or
Sun Mountain, formed of horizontal beds of sandstone
(this formation is as peculiar to the region
as the strange level hill-tops are to the Cape
district of South Africa), the alternate hard and
soft layers of which produced most singular traces
on its sides, while near it stood two curious conical
peaks. He rested that night in an old mud-walled
palm-thatched house, situated on a great lonely
elevated land, and early next forenoon the travellers
rounded the end of the Sun Mountain, and
a glorious view of Roraima burst upon them,
with the sun’s rays lighting up its curious details.
‘Turn,’ says our author, ‘in any direction I
would, most wonderful scenery was presented to
my view, from the great pink precipiced Roraima
in the north-west, looking like a huge fortification
surrounded by a gigantic glacis, to the great
undulating plain stretching southward as far as
the eye could reach, where at the horizon land
melted into sky.’</p>

<p>This wonderful mountain is one of the greatest
natural curiosities on the face of the earth, and it
is much to be regretted that Mr Brown was not
able to inspect it more closely, and examine its
structure and individual features more in detail.
This was, however, rendered impossible by that
prosaic but irresistible obstacle, want of food! In
the vicinity of the mountain he found only
deserted villages, and the scanty supply of provisions
which he and his guide had carried up
from the plain was speedily exhausted. Our traveller
succeeded in ascending the sloping portion
of the marvellous mountain—in which Nature
seems to have furnished Art with a perfect model
of a fortress—to a height of five thousand one hundred
feet above the level of the sea. Between the
highest point reached by him and the foot of the
great perpendicular portion, towering high above,
is a band of thick forest. ‘Looking up at the
great wall of rock,’ says the writer, ‘two thousand
feet in height, I could see that a forest covered its
top, and that in places on its sides where small
trees or shrubs could gain a hold with their roots,
there they clung. The great beds of white, pink,
and red sandstone of which it is composed are
interbedded with layers of red shale, the whole
resting upon a great bed of diorite.’</p>

<p>One tries in vain to picture to one’s fancy this
wondrous mass of upheaved earth, stone, and
forest, looking like a fortress reared by Titans
against the assaults of all the forces of Nature
besides. Science tells us that Roraima and its
surrounding similarly shaped neighbours once
stood as islands in the ocean; but at what period
of the earth’s history, how far back in the
awful lapses of time, who can say? ‘If,’ says the
author, ‘any mammals then lived upon them,
when the sea washed the bases of their cliffs, the
descendants of those mammals may live there still,
for all communication with their tops and the
surrounding country has been ever since effectually
cut off by their perpendicular sides.’</p>

<p>The length of Roraima is about twelve miles;
and its top is perfectly level. ‘The area of the
surface,’ says Mr Brown, ‘must be considerable,
for Sir R. Schomburgk, who visited its southern
end, to the westward of the point to which I
ascended, describes some beautiful waterfalls as
leaping from its sides, forming the drainage of
part of its top, and when viewing it from a mountain
on the Upper Mazaruni, I distinctly saw, at
a distance of thirty miles, an enormous waterfall
on its north-east side, of very considerable width
and extraordinary height.’</p>

<p>Next in importance to the great mountain
Roraima is the great Kaieteur Fall, which the
traveller reached by the difficult ascent of Kaieteur.
The very existence of this beautiful Fall was previously
unknown to the dwellers in George-town,
the capital of Demerara, who were astonished to
learn that their colony possessed such a gigantic
natural wonder; and indeed received Mr Brown’s
account of it with some incredulity. On a subsequent
journey, undertaken by command of the
governor Sir John Scott, Mr Brown and some
other English gentlemen made a thorough examination
and a scientific report of the Fall.</p>

<p>The Kaieteur Valley is of great extent; bounded
by gloomy mountains, whose outlines are broken
by gaps and gorges, whence noisy cascades pour
down the sides of the great sandstone steeps, while
in the far distance is seen the upper portion of the
Kaieteur pouring its foaming water over the precipice
edge into the depths below. The journey from
the landing-place on the river to the head of the
Fall is difficult, the way lying through blocks of
sandstone and through tangled forest, where it is
necessary to cut away the mass of vines, bushropes,
shrubs, and undergrowth which obstruct the path.
The regular forest ends in a confused mass of rocks
at the water’s edge, covered with shrubs and
mosses, and directly facing the Fall at a distance
of a quarter of a mile from its foot. A more perfect
position from which to contemplate this
wonder of Nature could not be conceived. The
travellers stood on the verge of the rock reef, and
before them thundered the Kaieteur Fall, from a
height of eight hundred and twenty-two feet, in a
cataract four hundred and twenty-two yards wide,
fed by the stream at a velocity of four miles an
hour; its contact with the water of the basin
being a confused scene of fleecy masses of tossing
waters, spurting high in the air in front of the
downpour, and giving birth to mist-clouds, which
rose continuously upwards and over the precipice
on the right.</p>

<p>Two of the exploring party swam across the
foaming river and visited the edge of the basin
on the eastern side; after which they returned
to the landing, accompanied by all the Indians
but three. The others did not like to pass the
night in such a mysterious place. Mr Brown
and one of his friends had poles rigged up and
lashed together under a large rock, which formed
a sort of cave, where they slung their hammocks
for the night. That must have been a night never
to be forgotten, when, in the primeval wilds of
that unknown land, the traveller lay in his swinging
couch and watched and listened to the eternal
fall and multitudinous roar of the mighty waters.
‘A subdued light,’ he says, ‘penetrated even into
our valley of shadows, and I knew that the moon
must have risen above the eastern horizon. By
this light I could make out the brink of the Fall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>{236}</span>
against the sky; and as I gazed upon it two bright
stars rose slowly beyond, looking as if they had
emerged from the water itself. Then the first rays
of the moon, as it rose above the mountain in the
east, shed a silvery light across the Fall’s crest,
and lit up a portion of the descending fleecy
column.’ During the day the sun’s rays, shining
on the mist, produced a lovely rainbow, reaching
from the top to the foot of the Fall, which,
moving slowly outwards with the mist, faded
gradually away, while with each accession of mist
a new one was formed.</p>

<p>After they had thoroughly enjoyed the spectacle
from opposite the foot of the Fall, the travellers
proceeded to its head, camped in the bush on the
river’s brink, about fifty feet above the edge of the
Fall, and there made their measurements. On both
evenings of their stay they watched with interest
the swallows’ homeward flight to their roosting-places
in a cave <i>behind the Fall</i>. The birds
came late in the afternoon in large flocks from
all quarters of the compass, and wheeled round
in great circles at different altitudes. Gradually
one flock amalgamated with another, till at
last near sundown they had gathered into two
or three immense bodies, which kept wheeling
round in a compact mass about one hundred yards
above the heads of the travellers. Mr Brown
asked his friend how he would describe their
numbers, and he replied that he thought ‘myriads
of millions’ would about do it.</p>

<p>While the travellers were wondering how the
birds would get into the cave behind the giant
sheet of falling water, the question was solved
in an extraordinary manner, and the intruders
on that wonderful scene beheld a spectacle
which in itself would have made the occasion
memorable. ‘Suddenly a portion of the mass
swooped down with incredible, with extraordinary
velocity to the edge of the Fall, seemingly close to
the face of the column of water, and then being
lost to our view. The rushing sound of their
wings in their downward flight was very strange,
and produced the feeling that birds of ill omen
were about. Approaching the edge of the precipice
we waited to see the next lot go down, so as
to observe how they managed to get behind the
water. We had not to wait long before down
dropped a cloud of them over the edge, past the
face of the Fall, for about one hundred feet; then,
with the rapidity of lightning, they changed their
downward course to one at right angles, and thus
shot through the mist on either side into the
gloomy cave. Their motions were so rapid that
we could hardly make out how they were executed.
It appeared to me that, as they swooped down,
their wings were but half spread, and their heads
downwards; but after passing the edge they turned
their bodies in a horizontal position, descending
by gravity alone until they arrived at the required
level, when they again made use of their wings
and flew off at right angles into the cave. Just
before dusk the greater portion descended in a
continuous stream for a considerable time, but
small flocks and single birds kept arriving until it
was quite dark. When a single bird shot down,
its velocity was so great that it seemed to form a
short continuous black line against the sky.’ This
gives the reader a vivid idea of the speed with
which a bird can cleave the air while on the swoop.</p>

<p>At all times the valley of the Kaieteur is beautiful,
but it is most beautiful when, in the afternoon,
great shadows are flung across it, and the opening
is lit up by the golden reflection of the sky over
the great plains beyond. On the Upper Essequibo—which
is inhabited by caymans of great size
‘and fearfully tame,’ there are also several beautiful
Falls; and as for a great portion of its extent
the banks of the river are totally devoid of human
population, the birds and mammals are as tame as
the caymans. Jaguars, whose prey are the wild
hogs, abound, and large tigers are tolerably numerous.
It is curious that they should not be more
numerous, for no animals prey upon them, and
the few killed by wandering Indians would not
affect their number in any sensible degree. Not
until the thirtieth day of their voyage on the
Upper Essequibo did the travellers see any
‘natives;’ then they fell in with a tribe of redskins
with artificially elongated and flattened heads, who
were terrified at the sight of white men. They
proved to be harmless and friendly people. It is
said that in this wild region, farther to the south,
near the head-waters of the Trombetas, there is a
tribe who have ponds of water encircled by stockades,
to which they retire for the night, sleeping
with their bodies submerged. This, however, the
author holds to be an Indian ‘yarn.’</p>

<p>The reader cannot weary of the details of the
numerous river-journeys by which Mr Brown has
succeeded in exploring the unknown ‘Interior’ of
British Guiana. In the course of them he has
penetrated into recesses of nature untrodden previously
by any human foot, and made acquaintance
with plants, animals, birds, and fishes of
which only the names had previously been known
to a few of the specially learned in such matters.
Our insufficient sketch of the nature of the book
in which he has narrated his experiences, is not
designed to satisfy, but to excite curiosity on the
subject, and to direct the attention of such readers
as are interested in the revelation of nature, for
which our age will be celebrated in the history of
intellectual labour, to Mr Barrington Brown’s
monograph of British Guiana.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Last</span> will and testament! Words of solemn import—and
of unreasonable terror to some people.
How foolish and even culpable is it to leave a
matter of so much importance to the last hours
of life, when the strongest intellect must be incapable
of fully considering and well weighing
the final disposition of our worldly goods and
effects—a disposition which is to affect the welfare
and perhaps the happiness of those we love the
best.</p>

<p>Most people have heard the well-worn aphorism
which tells us that the man who is his own lawyer
has a fool for his client. In the incident I am
about to relate, a woman—I suppose the aphorism
applies to either sex—proved to the contrary. It
is the exception, however, that proves the rule.
Had she remained her own lawyer, instead of
consulting me, the probability is that she would
have succeeded in her designs upon a large fortune,
designs which I happily succeeded in frustrating.</p>

<p>It had been a busy day with me. I had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>{237}</span>
working hard getting up evidence in a railway
accident case, and was putting up my papers with
a sigh of relief. Another forty minutes and I
should be at home. I could almost smell the
boiled capon and oyster-sauce which I knew were
being prepared for me. ‘There’s many a slip
’twixt the cup and the lip,’ says the proverb;
and in my case it proved only too true; for just
as I was tying up the last bundle of papers, the
office boy put his head in at the door and dispelled
the tempting vision.</p>

<p>‘A woman to see you, if you please, sir. She
won’t give no name. Says she’s a stranger.’</p>

<p>‘A stranger!’ I repeated. ‘What is she like?
Is she a common person?’</p>

<p>‘Not exactly, sir,’ replied the lad.</p>

<p>‘A lady?’ I asked.</p>

<p>‘O no, sir.’</p>

<p>‘What is she, then?’</p>

<p>Arthur was a droll lad. I had brought him to
London from the country, to oblige an old college
friend. I am afraid that he was not of much use
in the office, but he used to keep the other clerks
in a good temper by his amusing ways and dry
remarks.</p>

<p>Arthur paused, as if considering, and then, with
a look of intelligence, as much as to say that he
had hit the nail on the head this time, he
answered: ‘Well, sir, she’s a sort of betwixt and
between.’</p>

<p>‘Not a bad definition, Arthur. Ask the “betwixt
and between” up-stairs.’</p>

<p>A tall middle-aged woman entered and took
the seat I placed for her. She appeared to belong
to the class Arthur had so happily designated as
‘betwixt and between;’ a person, rather than a
lady. I rather pride myself on my power of
reading faces, but I confess that hers puzzled
me. It was absolutely void of expression. The
features were hard and immovable, as if carved
out of stone. She wore a closely fitting bonnet,
under which the gray hair was neatly brushed
in two smooth bands. I generally form my
opinion of any one’s character from the expression
of the eyes and mouth; but here I was at
fault. An ugly scar on the left cheek extended
across the lips, distorting the mouth, and the eye
on the same side was sightless. I always feel at
a disadvantage with one-eyed people; I never
know what they are driving at. It is so hard to
fathom their thoughts.</p>

<p>My visitor removed her gloves and, carefully
smoothing them, placed them on the table beside
her. She then produced from her pocket a large
foolscap envelope, from which she drew a piece of
paper folded longways. This she handed to me,
explaining, in a hard monotonous voice, that she
had been sent to me by her master, Mr Robert
Bramleigh of Coleman Street, who was dangerously
ill—in fact was not expected to live many
hours. The paper, she said, had been written by
his direction, and signed by him for his will that
afternoon. Fearing lest it should not be in a
proper form, he had desired her to take it to the
nearest lawyer, and have one prepared according
to the law.</p>

<p>I unfolded the paper, and read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘In the name of God, Amen. I leave my body
to the ground and my soul to Almighty God who
gave it. Now this is the will of me, <span class="smcap">Robert

leave all my houses, lands, money, and everything

<p>I examined the writing carefully. The signature
‘Robert Bramleigh’ was weak and shaky.
The will itself was written in a masculine-looking
hand of singular decision and boldness. The characters
were large and well formed.</p>

<p>The will had evidently been prepared by some
one who had had but an imperfect knowledge of
the form to be used for such a purpose. The
solemn appeal to the Deity and the bequest of
the testator’s body and soul was an old form, much
in vogue with our grandfathers, who generally
headed a will with one or two pious phrases.</p>

<p>The document shewn to me was, however, sufficient
to give Hannah Churton all Mr Bramleigh’s
property. There were the requisite number of
witnesses, and the Principal Registry of Her
Majesty’s Court of Probate would have granted
letters of administration with the will annexed
(the appointment of an executor having been
omitted, the ordinary probate could not have
been obtained), on one of the attesting witnesses
making an affidavit that the will had been executed
by the testator in the presence of himself
and the other attesting witness, and that they had
at the same time, and in the presence of each
other, subscribed their names thereto as witnesses.</p>

<p>Now I am always very particular about wills;
I think they are too serious to be settled in a
hurry. I never will allow a client to execute one
until I am convinced that its purport is perfectly
understood.</p>

<p>‘You are Mrs Churton, I presume?’ I asked.</p>

<p>‘I am,’ she replied, looking me unflinchingly in
the face. Somehow I felt suspicious that things
were not so fair as they should be. I questioned
her rather closely; but the only admission I obtained
from her was that <i>she</i> had written the will,
but that it was at her master’s dictation. I asked
her if he had any family, but could get nothing
from her save that he did not care to have his
private affairs discussed by strangers. Worsted, I
gave up the contest. I offered to prepare a more
formal document; but before doing so, I declared
that it was necessary I should see Mr Bramleigh.
I named the omission of the appointment of an
executor. This seemed rather to nonplus her.
She asked whether <i>she</i> could not be named as
executrix. The more aversion she shewed to my
seeing her master the more convinced I felt that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>{238}</span>
something was wrong; and seeing that I was not to
be moved from my purpose, she at last gave in;
proposing, however, that I should accompany her
back, as she greatly feared it would be too late if
left till the morning.</p>

<p>A cab soon took us to No. 559 Coleman Street.
It was a large gloomy old-fashioned house
with a spacious entrance-hall. I was taken into
the dining-room, and asked to wait while Mr
Bramleigh was being prepared for my visit. The
furniture in the room was old and very massive.
Some handsome oil-paintings graced the walls.
I am very fond of pictures, so raising the lamp,
I walked round the room slowly inspecting them.
On the right of the fire-place I came upon a
picture with its face turned towards the wall. I
think I must have the bump of inquisitiveness—if
there is such a bump—largely developed, for anything
approaching a mystery is sure to raise my
curiosity. I turned the picture. It was the portrait
in oils of a young and very beautiful girl in a
dark riding-habit. Hearing footsteps outside the
door, I restored the picture to the position in
which I had found it, and as I did so I saw
written at the bottom of the frame ‘Magdalen
Bramleigh.’</p>

<p>The footsteps I had heard were those of the
housemaid, who had come to announce that Mr
Bramleigh was ready to see me. I followed her
up-stairs, and was ushered into a large comfortable-looking
bedroom. A cheerful fire burned in the
grate. Facing it was a large four-post bedstead
hung with white curtains, and at the head of the
bed Mrs Churton was standing, with a small
table in front of her, on which were placed an
inkstand and some paper. She pulled back
the curtain, and I saw an old man propped up
by pillows, his face drawn and the eyes very
much sunk. I almost feared that he was too
far gone to make a will; but after speaking with
him for a little time, I felt satisfied that the
intellect was quite clear.</p>

<p>Turning to Mrs Churton, I told her that she
need not wait; I would ring if I wanted anything.</p>

<p>‘Yes, go—go, Hannah!’ cried the sick man;
and I fancied that I could detect an eagerness in
his voice, as if he desired her absence rather than
her presence. As Mrs Churton left the room I
caught sight of the reflection of her face in the
glass over the chimney-piece, but I do not think
she would have scowled quite so much had she
known that I was looking. I began by asking
Mr Bramleigh what were his wishes with regard
to his will. In low tones he told me that he
desired to leave everything to Hannah Churton,
his housekeeper, as a reward for her long and
faithful services. I will not tire the reader by
repeating the whole of our conversation. After
great difficulty I extracted from him that he had
no relatives save an only daughter, whom he had
discarded, her fault being that she had married a
young fellow in the army to whom her father had
taken an unaccountable aversion. My own opinion
was—and as the result turned out, it proved to be
correct—that his mind had been poisoned against
him by Hannah Churton, whose influence over her
master was evidently very great. I thought of
the sweet face of the portrait I had seen in the
dining-room—doubtless that of the discarded
daughter—and deserving or not deserving, I determined
to fight a battle on her behalf.</p>

<p>I spoke gravely to the old man, although without
much hope of success, but at last I got him to
confess that he had had no intention of making
his housekeeper his sole heiress until she had
herself broached the subject to him. Her plan
had been to artfully insinuate that the love
of the newly married couple would not last very
long on a lieutenant’s pay; and that as he had only
married Miss Bramleigh for her money, he would
soon tire of her when he found that she had
nothing. She had then pledged herself to procure
a separation, when she would make over everything
left her by Mr Bramleigh, to his daughter.
She certainly must have had great power over
the old man to induce him to agree to such a
scheme. I proposed to Mr Bramleigh that he
should leave his property to some one on whom
he could rely, in trust for his daughter. I also
volunteered, although I have an aversion to the
trouble and responsibility of a trusteeship, my
services as trustee for this purpose. My arguments
prevailed. He assented; and I prepared a will
accordingly, the old man requesting that his medical
man, Dr Ramsey, should be nominated as my
co-trustee, and that an annuity of fifty pounds
should be paid to Hannah Churton for life. I
inwardly rebelled at this. My dislike to this
woman was now so great that I could cheerfully
have seen her cut out of the will without a
farthing. The doctor arrived just as I had
finished, and expressed his willingness to share the
responsibility with me, which seemed to please
Mr Bramleigh very much. Our names were therefore
included as trustees.</p>

<p>I read the will to him very carefully, explaining,
as I did so, its full effect. When I had finished,
he muttered: ‘Quite right—quite right; but I am
afraid Hannah will not be pleased.’ I counselled
him not to mention it to her; and my advice
seemed to satisfy him.</p>

<p>Ringing the bell, I requested Mrs Churton to
summon James Burn and Margaret Sims, the two
servants who had witnessed the first will. As
soon as they were in the room, I gave Mr Bramleigh
a pen, and placing the document before him,
I said distinctly, so that all might hear: ‘This
which I have just read to you is your final will,
and you request James Burn and Margaret Sims
to witness your execution of it?’ ‘It is—I do,’
he solemnly said, as with feeble fingers he wrote
his name. The two awe-stricken domestics then
added theirs, and I think their hands shook more
than the testator’s. Hannah Churton was a silent
spectator of the whole of this; but I could not see
her face, as she stood in the background, out
of the light of the lamp.</p>

<p>Before allowing any one to leave the room, I
placed the will in a large envelope. Fastening it
with wax, I impressed it with Mr Bramleigh’s
monogram and crest by means of a seal that was
in the tray of the inkstand. The old man watched
me closely, and when I had finished, he said:
‘Keep it—till it is wanted;’ thus relieving me of a
great embarrassment, for I did not like leaving it
in the power of Hannah Churton, lest she should
tamper with it.</p>

<p>On our way down-stairs, Dr Ramsey told me
that his patient was rapidly sinking, and that he
doubted whether he would live another twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p>Taking him into the dining-room and shutting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>{239}</span>
the door, I told him my suspicions of the housekeeper,
and that I felt afraid of leaving Mr
Bramleigh alone with her all night. He agreed
with me, and promised to send his assistant to
watch till the morning, when, if Mr Bramleigh
should still be living, he would on his own
responsibility place a trustworthy nurse in charge.
The housekeeper opened the door to let us out.</p>

<p>‘It is all right, Mrs Churton,’ I maliciously said
as the doctor wished her good-night. ‘I am quite
satisfied now. The will will be safe in my keeping.
By-the-bye,’ I added, looking her sharply in
the face, ‘had you not better let your master’s
friends know of the danger he is in? Dr Ramsey
says he does not think he will last much
longer.’</p>

<p>She mumbled something in reply, but I could
not catch what it was. I stayed talking upon
indifferent subjects, to while away the time until
the arrival of Dr Ramsey’s assistant. Mrs Churton,
however, was, unlike her sex, remarkably reticent;
I could only get the shortest replies from her.
She seemed very much astonished and rather displeased
when Dr Ramsey returned with his assistant.
He explained to her that although there
was no chance of saving his patient’s life, yet
his last moments might be alleviated by skilled
attendance; and therefore, as he himself could not
stay all night, he had brought his assistant for that
purpose.</p>

<p>In one’s experience of mankind we find that
it is possible to be sometimes too clever. Mrs
Hannah Churton was very clever, but she committed
two great mistakes. The first was in
consulting a lawyer. The will drawn by her—for
so it really had been—might have been upset
on the ground of undue influence. I say ‘might
have been,’ for there is nothing so hard to prove
as undue influence. The great point against her
was the ousting of a child in favour of a
stranger. Yet it would have been far from easy
to prove that she was responsible for this, as
Mr Bramleigh’s strange aversion to the army was
well known; he often had been heard to threaten
to discard his daughter if she ever should engage
herself to a military man—doubtless thereby
defeating his purpose, for the female mind is
such that from Eve to the present generation
the thing forbidden is the most desired. I think
the probabilities are that the matter would have
been compromised, and Hannah Churton enriched
by a few thousands of her master’s wealth.</p>

<p>Mistake number two was as follows. The doctor
had gone up-stairs to install his assistant, leaving
me standing in the hall with the housekeeper.
Fumbling in her pocket she pulled out a roll of
bank-notes; thrusting these into my hands, she
told me that it was her master’s wish that I
should take them for my trouble. I unrolled
them, and found two for ten, and one for five,
pounds. Twenty-five pounds!</p>

<p>This was sharp, and yet foolish of Hannah.
Had I been as great a rogue as she was—and I
suppose by her offering them to me that she
thought I was—she was retaining an important
witness on her side, and therefore there was a
certain amount of sharpness about it. On the
other hand it was exceedingly foolish. The sum
was so much out of proportion to my services
that it was palpably a bribe. I am afraid that
had it come out in evidence, it would have lost
her the case and perhaps struck me off the
rolls.</p>

<p>A long legal experience has taught me that in
all dealings with doubtful people one’s safety
lies in having a good witness. I waited till the
doctor came down-stairs, occupying myself by
entering the numbers of the notes in my pocket-book.</p>

<p>‘Look, doctor!’ I cried as he appeared, shewing
him the notes. ‘Mr Bramleigh is a liberal paymaster.’
Turning to Mrs Churton, I said: ‘This
will amply repay me.’</p>

<p>Retaining the note for five pounds, I returned
her the other two. She took them from me
without saying a word, but a black look came
over her face. I think she began to suspect me.
I got home very late that night. The capon was
more than done, and so was the oyster sauce!</p>

<p>Mr Bramleigh died the next morning at ten
o’clock. Soon after I had left he became unconscious,
in which state he remained till shortly
before his death, when there was a rally. Opening
his eyes with an eager look, as if he missed something,
he threw one arm outside the coverlet, and
crying ‘Magdalen, Magdalen!’ he obeyed the
summons which bade him thole his assize—yea,
in that dread court where ‘Not proven’ is unknown.
Guilty or not guilty? Who shall say?</p>

<p>The funeral took place on the Saturday, but an
engagement prevented me from following. Mrs
Churton had written requesting that I would
attend with the will, which still remained in my
possession with the one drawn by her.</p>

<p>I arrived at the house a little after one o’clock,
and was at once taken into the dining-room, where
I found Dr Ramsey, Mr Robson (a brother-practitioner),
and a handsome young fellow, who was
introduced to me as Lieutenant Maitland, the late
Mr Bramleigh’s son-in-law.</p>

<p>The door opened, and a young lady entered.
It did not require any introduction to tell me that
she was the original of the portrait, still with its
front turned towards the wall. Her face was
very beautiful, notwithstanding its extreme paleness
and the tear-swollen eyelids. She seated
herself by the fire, her husband standing behind
her, leaning his arms on the back of the chair.</p>

<p>Mrs Churton had closely followed Magdalen
Maitland into the room. She was dressed in deep
mourning, and wore a black crape cap; thus offering
a marked contrast to Mrs Maitland, who
was wearing a gray dress rather travel-soiled.
Apparently she had had no time to prepare her
mourning.</p>

<p>Dr Ramsey politely pulled forward a chair for
the housekeeper. Taking it from him with a
cold ‘Thank you,’ she placed it at the end of the
table, directly facing me. Very stern and forbidding
she looked in her black garments—her
features immovable, her hands resting on her
knees.</p>

<p>I was about to unseal the envelope containing
the will, when Lieutenant Maitland interrupted
me.</p>

<p>‘One moment, if you please,’ he said, placing
his hand on my arm. ‘Before this will is read,
I wish to say a few words. Mrs Churton tells
me that Mr Bramleigh has left her everything
unconditionally. I simply wish to express my
firm belief that Mr Bramleigh could only have
been induced to make such a will by unfair and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>{240}</span>
foul means. Although I have been the cause of
an estrangement between father and daughter, I
cannot think that he could so far forget his love
for her as to strip her of everything. It is my
intention, for her sake, to contest this will; and it
is with that view that I have requested my old
friend, Mr Robson, to be present to-day as my
legal adviser.’</p>

<p>His frank manly face was flushed with honest
excitement as, leaning over the back of his wife’s
chair, he took her face between his hands and
kissed it. ‘For your sake—not mine, dearest,’ I
heard him whisper.</p>

<p>Mr Robson bowed when his name was mentioned.
Mrs Churton still retained her position.
A painful silence succeeded, unbroken save by the
rustling of the paper as I broke the seal.</p>

<p>Magdalen Maitland had stolen her hand into her
husband’s protecting clasp. I withdrew the will
from its cover, and looked at Mrs Churton. Would
that firm face quiver when the lottery proved a
blank, and the fair castle fell because its foundations
had been built in the sand? I could not
help admiring the courage of the woman, and
certainly felt curious as to how she would stand
the ordeal through which she had to pass.</p>

<p>I read the will slowly and distinctly. It was
very short. Save the annuity of fifty pounds to
Hannah Churton for life, everything was left to Dr
Ramsey and myself, in trust for Magdalen Maitland,
to be settled on her as we in our discretion should
think fit.</p>

<p>Astonishment is a mild word to express the
feelings of those present, nor will I attempt
to do so. My tale lies with Hannah Churton.
Starting to her feet, she pushed the chair from
her, and stretching out one arm, gave utterance to
a fierce torrent of invective. The veil was lifted,
and the native coarseness of the woman’s nature
stood revealed. It was as I had feared. Unmindful
of the bounty of but too generous a master,
she heaped obloquy on his memory, and fearlessly
asserted that she had wasted the best years of
her life in his service!</p>

<p>Magdalen Maitland covered her ears with
her hands, to shut out the hard words. Her
husband led her towards the door; but Hannah
Churton intercepted them. Tearing her cap from
her head, she threw it on the ground before the
frightened girl.</p>

<p>‘Trample on it!’ she cried in a frenzied voice.
‘Your father’s victim has no right to wear it!’ I
must admit that she looked grandly tragic as she
declaimed these fierce words. I felt half sorry for
the poor defeated creature.</p>

<p>We had not a little trouble before the will
was proved. It was strongly opposed by a sharp
young fellow, who took up the case for Hannah
Churton. It was, however, ultimately settled by
an addition of another fifty pounds being made to
the annuity she was to receive.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Maitland sold out of the army; and
a rich relative of his dying soon afterwards, he
inherited a large estate in Devonshire, where he
and his wife went to reside.</p>

<p>Nine years have passed since then; and Mrs
Maitland declares that there are ‘silver threads
among the gold.’ The cares of a young family have
somewhat marred her good looks, but they will
live again in my little god-daughter Magdalen, who
promises to rival her mother in beauty.</p>
